# Java Code Generator CLI for RESTful Applications

## Description:
The Java Code Generator CLI is a powerful tool designed to streamline the process of creating RESTful applications in Java. It extracts metadata from a database and automatically generates a RESTful application.

## Key Features:
- Seamless Metadata Extraction: The CLI efficiently retrieves metadata from a database, enabling users to work effortlessly with existing data models.
- RESTful Application Template: The CLI provides a well-structured and scalable template for building RESTful applications, reducing development time and promoting best practices.
- Extensibility: With a forward-looking approach, the project is dedicated to expanding its support for multiple databases and frameworks to cater to diverse application development needs.

## Future Plans:
The project's roadmap includes ambitious plans to expand its capabilities, such as:
- Multi-Database Support: Introducing compatibility with various database systems, empowering developers to work with their preferred choices.
- Multi-Framework Support: Extending the CLI's functionality to enable the generation of RESTful applications using different frameworks, thus accommodating diverse development environments.
- Enhanced Customization: Enabling users to tailor the generated code to their specific project requirements through intuitive configuration options.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1

We start this project with a PostgreSQL database, as it is the one our team is most familiar with, and the Quarkus framework, as it is one of the most popular, fast, and efficient choices. As we move forward, we envision expanding support to other frameworks and databases, along with seamless integration with various applications and APIs. Our goal is to create a versatile and adaptable code generator that caters to diverse development environments and empowers developers to build exceptional RESTful applications

- Extract metadata from the existing PostgreSQL database.
- Generate the source code for database models representing entities.
- Generate the source code for R2DBC repositories to handle queries.
- Generate the source code for Quarkus web controllers to expose the API.

With its focus on simplicity, efficiency, and adaptability, the Java Code Generator CLI aims to become an indispensable tool in the toolkit of Java developers seeking to build RESTful applications rapidly and effectively.

Join us in this exciting journey as we shape the future of Java application development with Quarkus and beyond. Your contributions and feedback are always welcome!
